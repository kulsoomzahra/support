description:

The Tor Project maintains its own [Debian package repository](https://deb.torproject.org). Since Debian provides the LTS version of Tor, this might not always give you the latest stable Tor version. Therefore, it's recommended to install `tor` from our repository.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian based distributions:

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to running the code as root. This means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, e.g your user should be in the sudo group.

#### Prerequisite: Verify the CPU architecture

The package repository offers `amd64`, `arm64`, and `i386` binaries. Verify your operating system is capable of running the binary by inspecting the output of the following commend:

  ```
  # dpkg --print-architecture
  ```

It should output either `amd64`, `arm64`, or `i386`. The repository does not support other CPU architectures.

> **Note on Raspbian:** The package repository does not offer 32-bit ARM architecture (`armhf`) images. You should either [build Tor from source](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/install/#installing-tor-from-source), or install the version Debian offers.

#### 1. Install `apt-transport-https`

To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages available in sources accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). 

   ```
   # apt install apt-transport-https
   ```

#### 2. Add the following entries to `/etc/apt/sources.list` or a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` 

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

If you want to try experimental packages, add these **in addition** to the lines from above (Note, use whatever is the current experimental version instead of 0.4.5.x from the example below):

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.4.5.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.4.5.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Or nightly builds:

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to check the Operating System version.

**Note:** Ubuntu Focal dropped support for 32-bit, so instead use:

   ```
   deb     [arch=amd64] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   deb-src [arch=amd64] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   ```
   
Warning symptom, when running sudo apt update:

   ```
   Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
   ```
 
#### 3. Then import the gpg key used to sign the packages

Download the key directly into `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d` using Wget:  

   ```
   sudo wget https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/torproject.asc
   ```

#### 4. Install tor and tor debian keyring

We provide a Debian package to help you keep our signing key current. It is recommended you use it. Install it with the following commands:

   ```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```
